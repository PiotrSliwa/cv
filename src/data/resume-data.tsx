  about: 'Engineering Leader | Startup Builder | Researcher',
  summary: (
    <>
      As an Engineering Lead, I have led, always hands-on, engineering and
      research teams at Fortune 500 companies, universities, and startups. I
      have had an opportunity to build 4 startups from scratch, and
      bootstrapping one of them. Rapid prototyping, agile environment and lean
      processes that flexibly adjust to the extreme environment of startups make
      these organizations my favourite when it comes to the managerial
      challenges I can solve. I enjoy building and scaling highly efficient,
      trust-based teams shipping amazing products that change the world.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a Research Lead, I spearheaded a 5-year-long research project funded by
      the Polish National Science Centre, dedicated to developing a prototype of
      a digital manager - an AI system that manages a human organization.
      Findings from the research encompass, among others, models of AI-powered
      managerial functions, AI-powered managerial processes, digital twins of
      organizations, and predictive models of organizations.
      <br />
      <br />
      As an Engineer, I can contribute especially in the areas of cloud
      computing (AWS and GCP), distributed systems, security, predictive
      modelling with machine learning, data storage and processing, scraping,
      DevOps, and full-stack web development. Technologies are just tools - it's
      the outcome that matters, but I feel particularly fluent in the
      JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, React, SQL (i.e., PostrgreSQL and
      Oracle), MongoDB, and AWS ecosystems. I have trained quite a few ML
      models, too, mostly with the help of HuggingFace, SciPy, and Keras.
      <br />
      <br />
      I ‚ù§Ô∏è coding, building dynamic, innovation-oriented organizations, and
      raising my 2 amazing sons.

          As the Head of Engineering, I had the great opportunity to lead a team
          of outstanding engineers in building a pioneering instant income and
          employment verification solution that has helped underwriting teams
          around the world. Operating in a highly sensitive and regulated
          environment, we had to constantly think outside the box to maintain
          our innovative edge and reduce the time required for the traditional
          process by orders of magnitude, all while ensuring compliance with
          stringent regulations and the highest standards of data security.
          <br />
          <br />
          I was responsible for the overall architecture and security of the
          product that relied heavily on cutting-edge technology (AI/ML, cloud
          computing, interactive low-latency web applications), directly
          managing and scaling the engineering team, overseeing cross-functional
          dependencies, fostering creative and collaborative environment in the
          remote-first setting, and ensuring engineering compliance with
          security standards. As part of the Information Security Management
          leadership team, I played a key role in successfully guiding the
          company through the certification process for ISO 27001, GDPR, and UK
          DIATF. Additionally, I represented the engineering department in all
          due diligence processes and was responsible for maintaining top
          quality and ensuring the continuous, on-time delivery of software.

          approach to affordable Robotic Process Automation (RPA). With a small
          team of full-stack engineers, we delivered two tailor-made solutions:
          a phone bot that automated over-the-phone registration for a massage
          therapist franchise (developed before the GenAI revolution and the
          widespread adoption of such solutions), an automated debt collection
          process for a law firm. To get more funding, we took a contract to
          build a cash flow forecasting system based on a data lake.

          browsing history (duh!), and the project eventually failed. However,
