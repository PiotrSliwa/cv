  summary: (
    <>
      As an Engineering Lead, I have led, always hands-on, engineering and
      research teams at Fortune 500 companies, universities, and startups. I
      have had an opportunity to build 4 startups from scratch, and bootstrap
      one of them. Rapid prototyping, agile environment and lean processes that
      flexibly adjust to the extreme conditions of startups make these
      organizations my favourite when it comes to the managerial challenges I
      can solve. I enjoy building and scaling highly efficient, trust-based
      teams shipping amazing products that change the world.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a Research Lead, I spearheaded a 5-year-long research project funded by
      the Polish National Science Centre, dedicated to developing a prototype of
      a digital manager - an AI system that manages a human organization.
      Findings from the research encompass, among others, models of AI-powered
      managerial functions, AI-powered managerial processes, digital twins of
      organizations, and predictive models of organizations.
      <br />
      <br />
      As an Engineer, I can contribute especially in the areas of cloud
      computing (AWS and GCP), distributed systems, security, predictive
      modelling with machine learning, data storage and processing, scraping,
      DevOps, and full-stack web development. Technologies are just tools - it's
      the outcome that matters, but I feel particularly fluent in the
      JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, React, SQL (i.e., PostrgreSQL and
      Oracle), MongoDB, and AWS ecosystems. I have trained quite a few ML
      models, too, mostly with the help of HuggingFace, SciPy, and Keras.
      <br />
      <br />
      I ‚ù§Ô∏è coding, building dynamic, innovation-oriented organizations, and
      raising my 2 amazing sons.

          As the Head of Engineering, I had the great opportunity to lead a team
          of outstanding engineers in building a pioneering instant income and
          employment verification solution that has helped underwriting teams
          around the world. Operating in a highly sensitive and regulated
          environment, we had to constantly think outside the box to maintain
          our innovative edge and reduce the time required for the traditional
          process by orders of magnitude, all while ensuring compliance with
          stringent regulations and the highest standards of data security.
          <br />
          <br />
          I was responsible for the overall architecture and security of the
          product that relied heavily on cutting-edge technology (AI/ML, cloud
          computing, interactive low-latency web applications), directly
          managing and scaling the engineering team, overseeing cross-functional
          dependencies, fostering creative and collaborative environment in the
          remote-first setting, and ensuring engineering compliance with
          security standards. As part of the Information Security Management
          leadership team, I played a key role in successfully guiding the
          company through the certification process for ISO 27001, GDPR, and UK
          DIATF. Additionally, I represented the engineering department in all
          due diligence processes and was responsible for maintaining top

          approach to affordable Robotic Process Automation (RPA). With a small
          team of full-stack engineers, we delivered two tailor-made solutions:
          a phone bot that automated over-the-phone registration for a massage
          therapist franchise (developed before the GenAI revolution and the
          widespread adoption of such solutions), an automated debt collection
          process for a law firm. To get more funding, we took a contract to
          build a cash flow forecasting system based on a data lake.

          Problem: The field of AI/ML provides methodologies for building
          applications on top of flexible models that are trained rather than
          coded, allowing them to handle much more complex tasks with
          significantly less development effort. However, this huge booster
          comes with a correspondingly huge attack surface. How to utilize this
          magnificent power while maintaining robust security? Methodology:
          Meta-analysis of case studies and current research on the
          cybersecurity of AI systems. Conclusions: The analysis reveals
          significant vulnerabilities in AI/ML systems, including adversarial
          attacks, data poisoning, and model inversion. A key finding is that AI
          systems, particularly generative AI, are inherently open by nature,
          making it especially challenging to control potential vulnerabilities.
          The research emphasizes the urgent need for stronger defense
          mechanisms, alongside exploring counteroffensive strategies such as
          adversarial training and deception techniques to proactively safeguard
          AI systems against evolving threats. Implications for practitioners
          and businesses: This presentation is tailored specifically for data
          science practitioners, offering a perspective on AI systems from the
          standpoint of a hacker. The goal is to equip listeners with actionable
          knowledge on how to integrate cybersecurity into the development
          process, helping businesses proactively safeguard the confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability of their AI systems.

          The AI revolution has provided tools to build applications with
          unprecedented capabilities. Generative models can empower these
          applications with significant autonomy, offering user experiences that
          would have been considered sci-fi just a few years ago. With an
          abundance of open source models, datasets, and frameworks, we can now
          develop AI applications in days rather than years. We can do more with
          less. So, where&apos;s the catch? The easier it becomes to develop AI
          applications using pre-built components, and the more freedom they
          gain through powerful AI/ML models, the less control we have over
          their operation. In this session, we will deep dive into the
          challenges of AI cybersecurity, examining AI applications from a
          hacker&apos;s perspective to better understand the threats and risks.
          We will explore the fundamentals of AI cybersecurity, providing a
          foundation that will help you make more informed decisions.

          Problem: The security of genAI applications is largely dependent on
          the security of the models themselves. Due to their open nature, they
          are susceptible to potentially unlimited attack vectors.
          &quot;Guardrails&quot; come to the rescue - model auto-moderation
          mechanisms that restrict the freedom of the output tensor. Does the
          use of guardrails guarantee the security of the model's operation?
          <br />
          <br />
          Method: Case studies and meta-analysis of &quot;guardrails&quot;
          methods.
          <br />
          <br />
          Conclusions: At the moment, there is no universal, ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù
          guardrail method, and those that exist do not guarantee the security
          of the model. In every analyzed case, there is an input configuration
          that allows bypassing the security and achieving the intended
          malicious output of the model. Individual methods vary in
          effectiveness for certain groups of inputs, impact on the model‚Äôs
          performance, as well as in the cost of implementation and maintenance.
          These findings allow for outlining a functional security framework for
          genAI models.
          <br />
          <br />
          Significance for practitioners and business: The inability to
          definitively secure a model with guardrails methods, as well as their
          sheer diversity, means that each genAI application requires an
          individual security strategy. The presented conceptual functional
          security framework for genAI models aims to structure and facilitate
          this process.

          AI has recently sparked a lot of excitement. There‚Äôs a plethora of new
          tools coming into light, that are built on top of sophisticated deep
          neural architectures, and can solve increasingly complex tasks,
          comparably or even better than humans. We have all heard that AGI is
          coming in great strides. From this point, it seems like a matter of
          time when we outsource management and governance of human
          organisations to AI, as yet another task to automate. Are we ready as
          a society, to make this step? What is the current state of art? What
          do we already know about both technological and societal opportunities
          and constraints? This lecture summarises a 6-year-long series of
          interdisciplinary research, funded by Polish National Science Centre,

          Abstract: Undoubtedly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going
          mainstream. More and more AI agents come into existence to augment
          human agents in their work by synthesizing a gigantic body of
          knowledge in a conversational interface (e.g., ChatGPT), generating
          art from a provided description (e.g., Stable Diffusion), creating
          software code based on a provided description (e.g., Codex), just to
          name a few. It becomes evident that at some point an AI agent will
          similarly help human managers in their daily operations, and, when it
          reaches the level of artificial general intelligence (AGI), unlock
          completely new levels of performance and sustainability. The authors
          used the critical review method and identified a research gap
          concerning the development of a generalized, numerical model of an
          organization and its environment that could be applied in machine
          learning pipelines, and effectively support managers in the key
          management functions.

          Abstract: Both inter- and intraorganizational networks draw the
          attention of researchers and practitioners from various disciplines
          who view them as the fabric of the socioeconomic world. The network
          perspective is believed to successfully model most of the
          socioeconomic phenomena, which, in combination with the prospects of
          continuously advancing tools for automated data mining and machine
          learning, gives a tempting promise to effectively forecast
          socioeconomic events occurring in our societies and businesses.
          Despite their significance, the topic of event forecasting in the
          context of organizational networks appears unexplored. Therefore, the
          objective of this study was (1) to fill the theoretical gap by
          proposing a mathematical model for organizational network event
          forecasting, rooted in the social science to remain consistent with
          the theory, and (2) to experimentally evaluate how the model performs
          on real data and validate if the results support its use in practical
          applications. An implementation of the proposed model, based on a
          decision tree classifier, achieved a prediction accuracy of 87% on a
          longitudinal data sample and thus demonstrated the practical usability
          of the model.

          Abstract: The concept of Digital Twin suggests that every physical
          product needs a virtual counterpart which can be used for simulating,
          forecasting, and reasoning about the real product without a costly and
          risky physical interaction. We argue that organizational networks -
          the fabric of the whole socio-economic world - need analogous virtual
          representations (digital network twins) for researchers' and
          practitioners' disposal. However, our systematic literature review
          revealed that current conceptualizations of organizational networks
          have significant limitations which make them unsuitable for being used
          as a framework for building digital network twins. Therefore, the aim
          of this article is to present a conceptual framework of a digital
          network twin based on a multi-level multi-modal organizational network
          model. The proposed multi-graph representation unifies the levels of
          analysis (inter- and intra-organizational) and minimizes a priori
          assumptions about network characteristics.

          Abstract: The eSports (‚Äúelectronic sports‚Äù) phenomenon is relatively
          new and unexplored in the scientific literature, although it has
          existed in the practice long enough to evolve into a significant,
          rapidly expanding chunk of the economy. Its growth, reaching over 40%
          on a year-to-year basis, along with relatively young and open networks
          creates a space for remarkably interesting business opportunities.
          However, from the business model point of view, there is a significant
          gap in the literature providing practitioners with a view on emerging
          eSports networks and assisting the managerial process. This chapter
          contributes to the area with a research of several, emerging
          ego-networks of organizations. Methodologically, the study tested an
          approach leveraging the abundance of publicly available data on the
          organizations‚Äô social media profiles which were found to be remarkably
          expressive and provided insight into the evolution of individual
          ego-networks. The research resulted in a number of observations: new
          roles, specific interactions between the actors, as well as specific
          structural and evolutionary patterns in the network. The findings are
          believed to find use in the managerial practice and future research of
          the inter-organizational network development.

          decision processes in industries. It assesses credit risk for banks,
          it helps doctors diagnose illness, it even models traffic to drive
          autonomous cars. All happening basically on a daily basis, nothing
          unusual here. But what if it ruled us? In our most recent research we
          have been experimenting with networks of individuals and organisations
          to build predictive models providing forecasts of events occurring in
          the networks. If they prove satisfactory performance, they will
          underpin a new class of decision support systems augmenting decisions
          of managers, governments, and other executives, who will gain
          unprecedented viewpoint on the organisations they steer. This talk

          Abstract: Inter-organizational networks are becoming deeply rooted in
          the organization management‚Äôs practice and theory. Still, there is an
          evident lack of a data-driven, adaptive tool aiding managerial
          decision-making processes in the network context. The
          inter-disciplinary team of authors showed that modern approach
          including big data analytics and data science has a great potential to
          support this particularly sophisticated task. The article presented a
          novel approach of combining a domain model with big data analytics and
          machine learning and graph algorithms to forecast network events.
          Then, the model was verified against a selection of known and current
          managerial tasks in the inter-organizational context. The resulting
          concept of a decision support system presented an implementation of a
          human-machine environment in which the machine solved tasks of pattern
          recognition and the human (i.e. domain expert) interpreted the results
          on different levels of abstraction using the domain knowledge.

          Abstract: Electronic sports, widely known as eSports, are presumably

          modern history. Despite the business potential, though, the eSports
          industry remains relatively unexplored in the literature of the
          management discipline, especially from the network perspective. To
          fill the gap confirmed in the literature review, the research aimed at
          answering a question regarding the contents of eSports ecosystems ‚Äì
          who the actors are and how do they interact with each other. A
          multiple case study was carried out, involving content analysis of
          social media posts published by a selection of eSports-related
          organizations in order to identify and classify entities comprising
          the eSports networks. As a result, the authors proposed and described
          a network model of the eSports ecosystems consisting of distinct roles
          (stakeholders) and relationships observed in ego-networks of the
          investigated entities. The model can serve as a foundation for future
          research on the eSports ecosystems and provide a bird-view on the
